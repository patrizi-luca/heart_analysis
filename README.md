# Heart Failure Prediction Project

This project explores machine learning solutions for predicting the likelihood of heart failure. The dataset used for this analysis contains relevant features related to cardiovascular health.

## Files

- `eda.py`: Python script for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It includes code for visualizing data distributions, descriptive statistics, and relationships between variables. EDA is a crucial step before building machine learning models.

- `random_forest.py`: Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm. The script demonstrates how to use Random Forest for heart failure prediction, including model training, evaluation, and result reporting.

- `svm.py`: Implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. This script shows how to use SVM for heart failure prediction, including feature normalization, model training, evaluation, and result reporting.

- `network.py`: Implementation of a Neural Network using PyTorch. This script illustrates how to build and train a neural network for heart failure prediction, including feature normalization, model training, evaluation, and result reporting.
